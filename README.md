# Concurrent_Programming
Analyzing the performance increase in an algorithm by using concurrent programming with OpenMP and MPI.
We are performing a simple simulation of an epidemics scenario, results can be found in the associated pdf files.
In order to run the simulation yourself you must first generate the test files with the provided program.
